### Product Description: 

    SkyAlert is a self-contained weather monitoring system designed for
    automated observatories. SkyAlert monitors wind, humidity, rain, 
    temperature, daylight, dew point and cloud conditions and uses the 
    data to create a standard one-line weather data file that can be 
    used by most image automation software packages and observatory 
    roof control systems. The included software can produce custom 
    real-time weather graphs and generate jpeg or png format snapshot 
    images of the graphs which can be uploaded to the web via the 
    built-in ftp client. The software package also includes SkyAlert 
    Remote, which can be used for remote location installations.
